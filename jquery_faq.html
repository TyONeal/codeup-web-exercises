    <h3>Yellowstone</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Yellowstone was the first national park.</li>
    <li>Management and control of the park originally fell under the jurisdiction of the U.S. Department of the Interior, the first Secretary of the Interior to supervise the park being Columbus Delano.</li>
    <li> Yellowstone Lake is one of the largest high-elevation lakes in North America and is centered over the Yellowstone Caldera, the largest super volcano on the continent.</li>
    <li>Yellowstone Park is the largest and most famous megafauna location in the contiguous United States.</li>

</ul>
    <h3>Gateway Arch</h3>
<ul>
    <li>The national park consists of the Gateway Arch, a steel catenary arch that has become the definitive icon of St. Louis; a park along the Mississippi River on the site of the earliest buildings of the city; the Old Courthouse, a former state and federal courthouse where the Dred Scott case originated; and the 140,000 sq ft (13,000 m2) museum at the Gateway Arch.</li>
    <li>It is the smallest national park in the United States at 91 acres (37 ha), less than 2% the size of the next-smallest, Hot Springs National Park.</li>
    <li>The area surrounding the arch was redesignated as the "Gateway Arch National Park" (a national park) in 2018.</li>
    <li>Gateway Arch, known as the "Gateway to the West," is the tallest structure in Missouri.</li>

</ul>
    <h3>Indiana Dunes</h3>
<ul>
    <li>It was authorized by Congress in 1966 as the Indiana Dunes National Lakeshore and was redesignated as the nation's 61st national park on February 15, 2019.</li>
    <li>Along the lakefront, the eastern area is roughly the lake shore south to U.S. 12 or U.S. 20 between Michigan City, Indiana, on the east and the Cleveland-Cliffs steel plant on the west.</li>
    <li>There is little evidence of permanent Native American communities forming during the earlier years; rather, the evidence suggests that seasonal hunting camps were the norm.</li>
    <li> Joseph Bailly was the earliest recorded settler in the dunes. He moved here from trading villages around Niles, Michigan.</li>
